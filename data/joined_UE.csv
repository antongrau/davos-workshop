IDEI empowers smallholder farmers to overcome the constraint of water for irrigation by providing affordable irrigation technologies. Using these technologies farmers shift from once a year cultivation to round the year cultivation of crops. 
 
IDEI has developed and disseminated the following pro-poor technologies: 
1. Water lifting technologies such as treadle pumps for lifting water from below the ground and surface water sources  
2. Water application technologies (drip systems and sprinklers) which optimize water use in arid and semi arid regions 
3. Water storage technologies  
4. Sustainable agriculture technologies (vermiwash, bio-pesticides and fertilizers, nursery plantation) 
  
IDEI believes the poor are not “recipients of charity” but “entrepreneurs” eager to build their own future. IDEI is unique in promoting a pioneering market-development model which envisages the integration of poor smallholders with markets, both as buyers of inputs and as vendors of high-value agricultural produce. Besides developing and disseminating the relevant technologies, IDEI empowers smallholder farmers by informing and training them about better practices and inputs; and by integrating them into markets through better supply chains and market linkages. IDEI’s innovative “Profit for Progress” methodology involves creating and nurturing private sector supply chains engaged in the manufacture and distribution of the technologies at fair prices which incorporate a profit margin for themselves. 
 
Through its work IDEI has reached out to over 1.38 Million farmer households (7.4 million people) cumulatively. Currently there are over 50 members in the supply chain network that includes manufacturers, distributors, dealers and village based mechanics.  
 
IDEI’s programs have the following positive impacts:  
1. Economic Empowerment:  Net additional annual cash income of USD 400 per family, decrease in cost of irrigation and energy use per unit area irrigated, increase in employment, and multiplier effect in local economy as increased income is spent on local services and products. Till date customer farmers have generated over 7 Billion as net additional income (cumulatively @PPP) 
 
2. Environmental Well-being: Decrease in CO2 emissions and significant savings in diesel, electricity and water use. Till date 2.62 million tCO2 eq carbon has been ofset, 682 million litres of diesel saved and over 800 million kWh electricity saved. In addition to these 6.6 Billion cu mtr of water has been saved. 
 
3. Social Benefits: Decrease in seasonal migrations and women’s workload, improved access to education for children and better quality of life for smallholder families. Smallholders are no longer on the periphery of society as a marginalized group but active participants in social processes.  
 
4. Employment Generated: with the promotion of IDEI developed technologies till date over 610 million work days employment has been generated on the farm and over 1.79 Million employment generated in the supply chain.","national, regional/local","IDEI is not receiving any funding from EU sources currently.",NA,NA,NA,"NA",1,0.25,NA,NA,"Economy, finance and the euro, Agriculture and Rural Development, International co-operation and development, Energy, Environment, Climate Action","IDEI is associated with the following knowledge partners:

The mission of ICC is to promote open international trade and investment and help business corporations meet the challenges and opportunities of of an increasingly integrated world economy. 
ICC has three main activities: rule setting, dispute resolutions, and policy advocacy. Because its member companies and associations are themselves engaged in international business, ICC has unrivalled authority in making rules that govern the conduct of business across borders. Although these rules are voluntary, they are observed in countless thousands of transactions every day and have become part of the fabric of international trade. 
Business leaders and experts drawn from the ICC membership establish the business stance on broad issues of trade and investment policy as well as on relevant technical subjects. These include: banking, commercial law and practice, competition policy, corporate responsibility and anti-corruption, customs and trade facilitation, the digital economy, environment and energy, intellectual property, marketing and advertising, taxation, and trade and investment policy. 
ICC works closely with the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and intergovernmental forums including the G20. 
ICC was founded in 1919. Today its global network comprises over 6 million companies, chamber of commerce and business associations in more than 100 countries.

Europe's People's Forum allows and encourages every single person among the 500 million people in EU’s 27 countries to voice their opinions and visions and to influence the European Union through the policy proposals that are put forward. It is a key purpose for the Forum to ensure that the people’s proposals gain a serious impact on the policies in Europe. To have such impact the proposals must be credible, substantiated and coherent in a societal context.  
 
For this reason, Europe’s People’s Forum engages with partner organisations in all 27 countries to arrange national debates that focus on the specific thematic issues for debate that year. A Research Validation Panel will subsequently ensure that the final policy proposals presented by the representatives at the Europe’s People’s Forum are well documented. The ANNUAL process will culminate in the the large-scale highly publicized event organized annually by Europe's People’s Forum where hundreds of politicians and civil servants will discuss how to include the policy proposals in the decision-making process.

EPF is involved as a partner in a regional project within Slovenian EuropeanMovement and other organisations under EC’s Citizens Programme.

Our focus is on strengthening the power of European CSOs, working as part of a global movement to push governments and powerful institutions to adopt transformative changes to the global economic and financial system.  
 
Eurodad's Strategic Plan sets ambitious goals to help achieve: tax justice to stem the loss of resources in developing countries;  
ending debt crises that hinder economic progress; effective aid that will transform lives;  
publicly-backed private finance and investment agreements that accelerate development results;  
climate finance that is responsive to the climate adaptation and mitigation priorities of developing countries;  
and financial sector rules that promote prosperity and do no harm.  
 
Eurodad also has crosscutting priorities, which we integrate into all our work, of gender equality, global economic good governance, and responsible finance standards. 
 
The main institutions targeted by the Eurodad network include European governments, the World Bank, the United Nations, International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  
 
Eurodad's vision is a world with: 
Economic justice for all – an end to relative poverty and to the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. Fair, democratic, accountable and transparent governance – at local, national, regional and global level where all countries have a say, and all people can exercise their right to participate. Finance that serves the people – and helps ensure human rights for all, and an environmentally sustainable planet. This means it is publicly regulated to meet social ends and recognise environmental limits, and enhances systems of redistribution to ensure economic justice.  
 
Eurodad's key strengths include: 
Our deep and detailed understanding of the issues we work on.  
Our respected position with other allies and civil society networks, and our work with global and regional coalitions, in particular, our ability to develop joint strategies within our membership network, and our strong cooperation with allies from the global south. 
Our good connections to policy-makers and other influencers. 
Our ability to develop results-focussed strategies, and track progress to our goals.  
 
We adopt a flexible approach to the role we play, ensuring we focus on what our most useful contribution can be – in any given situation – to making the desired transformative policy change happen, recognising the strengths of our members and partners. We prioritise cooperation with partners from the global south, seeking to work in partnership whenever possible, to listen to and respect their priorities, and to try to align ourselves to those.

The Climate Action Network (CAN) is a worldwide network of over 750 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working to promote government, private sector and individual action to limit human-induced climate change to ecologically sustainable levels. CAN is based on trust, openness and democracy. 
 
The vision of CAN is a world striving actively towards and achieving the protection of the global climate in a manner that promotes equity and social justice between peoples, sustainable development of all communities, and protection of the global environment. CAN unites to work towards this vision. 
 
CAN's mission is to support and empower civil society organisations to influence the design and development of an effective global strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure its implementation at international, national and local levels in the promotion of equity and sustainable development. 
 
CAN Europe is committed to transparency about EU interest  
representation. CAN Europe believes that this register fails basic transparency standards and that it does not provide EU lobbying transparency.  
 
When registering, we have therefore chosen to give all relevant information that we consider necessary for lobbying transparency. A credible EU lobbying transparency register should include names of individual lobbyists and the issues that they try to influence, provide precise and comparable financial information on lobbying, and have effective sanctions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed. In an effort to arrive at a more objective way of calculating lobbying expenditures, we follow guidelines that result from consultations with public interest organisations, professionals working on lobby transparency as well as experts of US lobby disclosure legislation. Our registration is therefore providing a more comprehensive calculation of our expenses for activities that aim to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the European institutions, and a list of those who, on behalf of CAN Europe, carry out such activities.   
  
Our registration is based on the guidelines for transparent registration developed by the Civil Society Contact Group and ALTER-EU.

TAP will transport natural gas from the giant Shah Deniz II field in Azerbaijan to Europe. The approximately 870 km long pipeline will connect with the Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) near the Turkish-Greek border at Kipoi, cross Greece and Albania and the Adriatic Sea, before coming ashore in Southern Italy. 
 
TAP’s routing can facilitate gas supply to several South Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia and others. TAP’s landfall in Italy provides multiple opportunities for further transport of Caspian natural gas to some of the largest European markets such as Germany, France, the UK, Switzerland and Austria. 
 
TAP will promote the economic development and job creation along the pipeline route; it will be a major source of foreign direct investment and it is not dependent on grants or subsidies. With first gas sales to Georgia and Turkey targeted for late 2018, first deliveries to Europe will follow approximately a year later. 
 
TAP’s shareholding is comprised of BP (20%), SOCAR (20%), Snam (20%), Fluxys (19%), Enagás (16%) and Axpo (5%). 
 
TAP AG has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland and offices in Athens, Tirana, Rome, and Lecce.

- EU Journalism Fellowship: Between 2011 and 2013, 38 young journalists working in a dozen different European media received a one-week induction seminar and a five-week on-the-job training on EU reporting for three different media in Brussels (EURACTIV, DPA Agency, Radio France). This project has been implemented thanks to the generous support of the Robert Bosch Stiftung (2011-2013), Open Society Foundation (2012) and Fondation Hippocrène (2013).

COMECE is formed by the Bishops' Conferences of the European Union's Member states. 
 
The COMECE Secretariat, as a Church representation, fully supports the goal of bringing greater transparency to the legislative and policy-making process at the EU level, as an important element of a democratic and pluralistic society, and for this reason and in this spirit entered the present registration system in 2011. However, it also advocates for a re-balancing of the burden of transparency, currently placed more on citizens and organisations, rather than on public officials. Furthermore, the risk of exclusion of actors that enjoy no ""formal status"" (e.g. migrants, the elderly, the poor, Roma people, informal youth groups, social movements), due to the lack of specific provisions to allow for access to decision-makers, is a source of concern.  
 
We recognise ourselves in the definition of ‘Organisations representing churches and religious communities’, as contained in the 2014 Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission on the transparency register for organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making and policy implementation (“Legal entities, offices or networks set up for representation activities”). We also fully support the idea that the register does not apply to Churches themselves, as specified in the Agreement. 
 
However, we would like to emphasise that the lobbying and/or interest representation terminology (still used in a generalised way e.g. in the introductory sentence to the Code of Conduct; in various passages of the ‘Guidelines’ document; and in the Proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement on a mandatory Transparency Register) cannot be applied to us as a Church representation.  
 
On the basis of Article 17(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), we are involved in Dialogue with the EU institutions as a representation of a Church entity, having a specific contribution to make to the common good and a peculiar identity, status and dignity, not as a lobby group or interest representative or single-issue organisation. We see our contribution as being mainly of a moral and ethical nature, but also rooted within the Social Doctrine of the Church. This contribution is constantly inspired by the Gospel and by the Catholic Church’s reflection on the dignity of each human being as created in God’s image. We operate in search of the common good, not in the name of ‘business’ or ‘interests’ (as typical features of lobbying and interest representation). Finally, we are not conditioned by third-parties' interests. 
 
COMECE emphasises that registrations under Section V of the Transparency Register should be consistent with the binding formulation of Article 17 TFEU. Therefore, registration in the present Section should concern only ""organisations representing"" the actors described in Article 17, paragraph 1 TFEU.","European","The Future of Europe; Multiannual Financial Framework; Implementation of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief; Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU; General Data Protection Regulation; Compliance with fundamental rights and the rule of law (e.g. crimininalisation of circumcision); Revision of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive; Countering “fake news”; Proposal for an Interinstitutional Agreement on a mandatory Transparency Register; Cross-border family law; Reconciliation of family and professional life; European Solidarity Corps; European Pillar of Social Rights; EU-Africa Summit; European External Investment Plan (Private Investment & Development); European Defence Fund (European Defence Industrial Development Programme); A Strategic Approach to Resilience; Shrinking civil society space in developing countries; Eastern partnership Summit; Trade policy; EU Strategy for “A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans”; Digital and biotechnological innovation (monitoring EU support for research and innovation under the special focus of ethical implications for the human being and society: Artificial Intelligence, Nanotechnology, biotechnological innovations e.g. gene-editing); EU Health Policy (monitoring EU support for health under the special focus of ethical implications for human dignity: EU Health Program, eHealt/digital health and care, EU One Health Action Plan); Common European Ayslum System (CEAS) reform; European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018; Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; Anti-Microbial Resistance.","Events: EP Inter-religious event with the participation of Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities on “Religious rituals and fundamental rights (criminalisation of circumcision) (10 April 2018); EP Meeting on ""The roots of fundamental rights and the rule of law"" (13 March 2018); Farewell event for COMECE President Card.

IBM in Europe: 
 
IBM has been investing in Europe for over 100 years, starting in Germany in 1910. The company operates today across the EU. The company has had a strong presence in Central and Eastern Europe since the Czech office opened in 1932. 
 
IBM is just as much at home in Europe as anywhere else in the world. For more than a century, we have been working in Europe on innovation that matters to Europeans. Four of our European-based lab scientists have been awarded Nobel prizes for physics and many of the 8,088 patents received in 2017 were filed at the European Patent Office in Munich. 
IBM is present all across Europe and our team here is as large as our team in the United States. We continue to invest in Europe: in cutting-edge research and new data center facilities, creating jobs across the continent and fostering a new generation of scientists and technology experts. IBM plays an active role in Europe’s digital ecosystem, partnering and sharing resources, technology and know-how with start-ups and SMEs, enabling them to be more competitive and innovative. Having been actively involved in the EU’s FP7 research programme, we are now launching collaboration in numerous Horizon 2020 projects which started in 2014. IBM has been involved in 43 funded projects, with more than 500 partners and has received 7 European Research Council grants – all in an effort to create and innovate for the benefit of Europeans. In Europe, public services, governments and companies – large and small – work with us to provide more forward thinking, more effective, healthier and safer services to their citizens & customers.  
In February 2017, IBM opened its global headquarters for Watson Internet of Things (IoT) in Munich. The Watson IoT HQ brings together over 1000 developers, engineers, consultants, researchers and scientists on a campus environment driving innovation with SMEs and start-ups, governments, schools and universities and investors.","global","As a major investor and employer in Europe, IBM has a wide interest in public policy.
